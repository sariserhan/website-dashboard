hello there! Welcome to the COSMIC Slide Playground.

Steps to get up and running:
**ADAM DOES THESE***
1. Adam creates new template page, url entry, view entry for new user.
	specify path to data, title, path to JSON object config.
2. Adam creates new data directory with at least a few sample images under /data/galleryPlayground/{YOUR USER DIR HERE}.
3. Adam pushes new changes.

As user Webops:
4. Adam pulls in the updated web dashboard code with new user info as Webops.
5. Make sure all dirs involved here have 775 permissions! and 664 for images/JS files. even after git Clone we need to change permissions again.
6. Adam copies over config1.js file from existing user for base config file for new user.

***ADAM DONE WITH STEPS***


Time to add some user images! 

On monproc-dev: 

*start*

- ssh monproc-dev.cosmic.ucar.edu

As your own user,
Once in monproc-dev:
  Use gnssProc repo to generate plots via:
  - cd {path to your locally cloned GNSS proc repo}
  - cd gnssProc/
  - source env/envfile
  - cd c2Monitors/bin/
  run a test command, i.e.:
    - dbOccSummary.py -dbhost leo-stage-ml1 -d1 -1 -d2 -1 -m coseqrt -chartjs
    this should generate some plots and  chartJS files.  

Now, let's transfer some images over from monproc-dev to monweb-dev.

on monproc-dev, in same directory you just ran the dbOccSummary command,
                or in the directory where images live that you want to transfer over, run:
  -  scp {images you want to copy over} {your user}@monweb-dev.cosmic.ucar.edu:/opt/tools/django/web-dashboard/src-dashboard/data/galleryPlayground/{Your User Dir Here}/.
  This will ask for Duo password, enter, and selected images should be transferred over to monweb-dev!

Back to monweb-dev!
cd to the path where your new config gallery lives:
  - ssh monweb-dev.cosmic.ucar.edu
  - cd /opt/tools/django/web-dashboard/src-dashboard/data/galleryPlayground/{Your User Dir Here}/.
  your new images should be here:
  -  ls -lah
  should show all images located in this directory, as well as the config file.

check changing permissions on the newly transferred images:
  - chmod 664 {name of new images}

If you want subdirectories in this directory, do:
  - mkdir {Name of new directory}
  - chmod 775 {name of new directory}/
  - cp {selected images} {name of new directory}/.
  - chmod 664 {name of new directory}/*
Now, edit the layout!

your config1.js file looks like this:

- vi config1.js

var pathID = "/data/galleryPlayground/{your user dir here}/";

var galleryConfig1 = {
  "group1": {
    "captions": [
      "Maggie test All, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L1  user sunshine can edit? FM1, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L1 FM2, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L1 FM3, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L1 FM5, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L1 FM6, past 24 hours"
    ],
    "header": "SNR by FM in units of V/V",
    "images": [
      "neutral_atm_snrAveL1_leo-stage-ml1_coseqrt_2021-02-16_to_2021-02-16_all.png",
      "neutral_atm_snrAveL1_leo-stage-ml1_coseqrt_2021-02-16_to_2021-02-16_fm01.png",

      "neutral_atm_snrAveL1_leo-stage-ml1_coseqrt_2021-02-16_to_2021-02-16_fm06.png"
    ],
    "numCol": 6,
    "title": "COSMIC-2 SNR L1 | Past 24 Hours"
  },
  "group2": {
    "captions": [
      "SNR L2 ALL, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L2 FM1, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L2 FM2, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L2 FM3, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L2 FM5, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L2 FM6, past 24 hours"
    ],
    "header": "SNR by FM in units of V/V",
    "images": [
      "neutral_atm_snrAveL2_leo-stage-ml1_coseqrt_2021-02-16_to_2021-02-16_all.png",
      "neutral_atm_snrAveL2_leo-stage-ml1_coseqrt_2021-02-16_to_2021-02-16_fm01.png",
      "neutral_atm_snrAveL2_leo-stage-ml1_coseqrt_2021-02-16_to_2021-02-16_fm02.png",

    ],
    "numCol": 6,
    "title": "COSMIC-2 SNR L2 | Past 24 Hours"
  }
};


If you want to add a new group, use the template below! Also, make sure to check commas.

add this to the galleryConfig1 variable in whatever order you would like them displayed.

the group variable ("group1") can be called whatever.

"group1": {
    "captions": [
      "Maggie test All, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L1 FM1, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L1 FM2, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L1 FM3, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L1 FM5, past 24 hours",
      "SNR L1 FM6, past 24 hours"
    ],
  "header": "SNR by FM in units of V/V",
    "images": [
      "neutral_atm_snrAveL1_leo-stage-ml1_coseqrt_2021-02-16_to_2021-02-16_all.png",
      "neutral_atm_snrAveL1_leo-stage-ml1_coseqrt_2021-02-16_to_2021-02-16_fm01.png",
      "neutral_atm_snrAveL1_leo-stage-ml1_coseqrt_2021-02-16_to_2021-02-16_fm02.png",
      "neutral_atm_snrAveL1_leo-stage-ml1_coseqrt_2021-02-16_to_2021-02-16_fm03.png",
      "neutral_atm_snrAveL1_leo-stage-ml1_coseqrt_2021-02-16_to_2021-02-16_fm05.png",
      "subdir/neutral_atm_snrAveL1_leo-stage-ml1_coseqrt_2021-02-16_to_2021-02-16_fm06.png"
    ],
    "numCol": 6,
    "title": "COSMIC-2 SNR L1 | Past 24 Hours"
  }

Update the title, header, captions (include a comma), and images (name of image, path to image if
in a subdirectory under this director). make sure image name matches the name of the images you created! 

Lightgallery will automatically build the display based on this galleryConfig1 variable. 

You can edit currenty:
  - Title: Display will put Title and Header together for group display
  - Header: will display after Title in Group Header display
  - Captions: Text before comma displayed first, sub caption after comma (time frame in this example).
  - Images: path(only in a subdir) and name of images you want displayed, in the order you want them displayed.

  - If you want a subdir, include the subdir at the beginning of the images entry, without a /.
  - numCol isn't currently functional.

make sure to click Chrome settings and clear browsing data to refresh reload of the JS config on the web display! 
Then, reload the page, and you should see the updated layout. 

also make sure to update your pathID variable to the directory path under /data that matches the path to config1.js and images. 

Have fun!
